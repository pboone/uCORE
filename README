  To get the Django back-end setup, you may need to add your template directory to the TEMPLATE_DIRS setting in settings.py.

The KMZ file referenced is hard coded in core.js. You will need to point our google earth ext plugin to the KML you plan on using.

Here's some KML files to use:

Testing if I can push this to another repo.
